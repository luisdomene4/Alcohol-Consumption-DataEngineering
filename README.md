# Alcohol-Consumption-DataEngineering
Final project of the Course Data Engineering 

## Context:
This analysis serves as the final project for the Data Engineering course, undertaken by a team comprising Joan Bayona Corbalán, Marino Oliveros Blanco, and Luis Domene García. The dataset utilized in this project was gathered through surveys conducted among students enrolled in mathematics and Portuguese language courses in secondary school. It encompasses a diverse array of socio-economic, demographic, and academic attributes of the students, making it suitable for exploratory data analysis.

## Content:
The dataset comprises two separate files, student-mat.csv and student-por.csv, corresponding to the math and Portuguese language courses, respectively. Each file includes attributes such as school, sex, age, address type, family size, parental cohabitation status, parental education levels, parents' occupations, reasons for school choice, guardian information, travel time to school, study time...etc. Additionally, the dataset includes three grade columns, G1, G2, and G3, representing the first period, second period, and final grades, respectively, for both math and Portuguese courses.

In this repository, you'll find my contribution, which focuses on investigating the potential relationship between students' alcohol consumption and their academic performance.
